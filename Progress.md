crawler ===> structure done ☑️
        ===> needs to go through the function and add the missing details (Gehad please 🥹🥹🥹)
        ===> should be preferably done by wednesday at most (Hagar is also working on it if we need help)

Indexer ===> very basic layout ☑️
        ===> fully integrate the database, think about what to store ☑️
        ===> then we'll go over details together (probably mostly Gehad 😔)    
        ===> should be done by next sunday (hopefully) (either Esraa or Aliaa is working on it if we need help)


# ps note: 
        I think we'll have to go through the structure and the storing of the database again once we know for sure what to do with the details of every class , right now, all we have is a hopefully very well built container to fill
