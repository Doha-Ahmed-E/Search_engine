crawler ===> structure done ☑️
        ===> needs to go through the function and add the missing details (Gehad please 🥹🥹🥹)
        
        Key Features Added:
                        Complete URL Normalization - Proper handling of different URL formats

                        Robots.txt Compliance - Full parsing and caching of robots.txt rules

                        Rate Limiting - Per-domain request rate limiting

                        Content-Type Checking - Verifies only HTML content is processed

                        Improved Thread Safety - Better synchronization in all components

                        Graceful Shutdown - Proper shutdown handling with Runtime hook

                        Enhanced Link Scoring - More sophisticated prioritization algorithm

                        Bloom Filter Option - Ready for scaling with Bloom filters

                        State Persistence - Structure in place for saving/loading crawl state

                        Error Handling - Comprehensive exception handling throughout

Indexer ===> very basic layout ☑️
        ===> fully integrate the database, think about what to store ☑️
        ===> then we'll go over details together (probably mostly Gehad 😔)    
        ===> should be done by next sunday (hopefully) (either Esraa or Aliaa is working on it if we need help)


# ps note: 
        I think we'll have to go through the structure and the storing of the database again once we know for sure what to do with the details of every class , right now, all we have is a hopefully very well built container to fill
